                Hello! We are Santoso Media Tama, part of the PT Santoso Media Tama, and we make games,
                including The Wolfstein. We've put a lot of work into building Santoso Media Tama and as a result we need
                to have some rules about what you can and can't do with our games and services. We've put this Agreement
                together as simply as we legally can, with some informal short summaries to help you understand what it
                means. However, the full text wording is what is important/binding legally.
            </p>

                        1.1 This Agreement. This Agreement is a legally binding contract between you and PT SMT,
                        seated at Jl Jakenan Winong Dk Banglean RT 007 RW 001 59182, Ds Tambahmulyo Kec Jakenan,
                        Kab Pati Prov Jawa Tengah, Indonesia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just so you know, Santoso Media Tama is the name of the game development studio within PT SMT,
                        so we will refer to ourselves throughout this Agreement as "SMT", "we" or "us".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement applies to <a href="https://ptsmt.tech">ptsmt.tech</a>, any other
                        PT SMT websites, any and all SMT games (except those specifically mentioned
                        below) including The Wolfstein, SMT forums, wikis, blogs,
                        social media accounts, SMT accounts, SMT customer and technical support
                        and any other services we provide to you (we'll call all this "SMT games and
                        services" for short).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement does not apply to SMT or Magickpunk : Beginning of Magick, which each have their
                        own legal documents (you can find SMT’s EULA here and Magickpunk : Beginning of Magick’s EULA
                        here).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is binding on you and us once you use any SMT games and services. If you do not
                        agree to it, you are not permitted to use the SMT games and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Important: please also make sure you read our: (a) game/service specific rules
                        (e.g. the Wolfstein EULA) - which explain in more detail the legal rules for specific games
                        or services; and (b) SMT Privacy Policy - which details SMT’s collection,
                        usage and protection of your personal information. Our Fan Content Guidelines explain what you
                        can and cannot do with fan content about our games and services. All of these documents form
                        part of this Agreement, and we may update them from time to time. You may also need to agree
                        and follow terms and conditions of any digital distribution platforms which you use to access
                        and play SMT games and services, such as our awesome sister company GOG.

                        This agreement explains what the SMT games and services are and how you can use them.
                        We’ve included here a short, informal summary of these rules to make it easier for you. However,
                        it is the full version on the left which is legally binding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement covers most of our games and services, but some have their own specific rules
                        (e.g. SMT and Magick : Beginning of Magick).

                        1.2. Age Restrictions. Every SMT video game has its own age rating (e.g. PEGI, ESRB)
                        which may differ depending on where you are located and will be displayed when you purchase the
                        game. You should only play our games if you meet the applicable minimum age rating. If you are
                        above the applicable minimum age rating, and you are over 18 (or whatever is the age of adulthood
                        in your country) then please enjoy our games. If you are under 18 (or whatever is the age
                        of adulthood in your country) – before we extend an equally warm welcome, please ask your parent
                        or guardian to review and approve this Agreement on your behalf (because in some countries
                        people under a certain age cannot legally enter fully into contracts like this Agreement), plus
                        they should supervise your use of the games, even if the age rating for a given game is lower
                        than 18 year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Check the age rating of a SMT game before you start playing. If you are not yet 18
                        years old, you need parental/guardian approval, even if game is rated as suitable for minors.
                        We know it sounds kind of silly – no, it is not our own invention, but actually a legal
                        requirement.

                        1.3 Content Warning. Some SMT games and services contain scenes and images
                        of violence, sexuality, and drug use that some may find disturbing. If you are sensitive to
                        such content or such content is a trigger for you, please be aware of this before you begin
                        playing the game.

                        respective websites).This licence is for your personal use only (so you can't give, ‘sell’,
                        lend, gift, assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer it to someone else) and doesn't give
                        you ownership rights in the SMT games and services.

                        images, which may induce epileptic seizures. If you or anyone in your household has an epileptic
                        condition, please consult your doctor before using the SMT games and services. If you
                        experience dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation,
                        any involuntary movement, or convulsions while playing, immediately discontinue use and consult

                        3.1 We may release 'beta' versions of SMT games and services before their full commercial
                        release. If so:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            your access to the beta will usually be time-limited and there may be some additional
                            contract terms;

                        <li>
                            you will probably be asked to participate in a feedback process in which you can offer
                            information about how the beta works;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the beta software will be provided 'as is' without any additional promises from us or any
                            liability on us if the software isn't complete or doesn't work fully or causes issues. After
                            all, that's the point of us giving you beta access: you get beta access to something new,
                            but you recognise that it won't be complete yet; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the game or service may have specific legal rules of its own for its beta, so check them
                            out.
                        </li>

                        further how we are responsible legally for SMT games and services.

                        systems, but we only have limited time to carry out tests, and we don't always get everything
                        right. Therefore, we can’t accept any liability or responsibility if SMT games and
                        services do not work fully or completely. Also, we are not responsible or liable for anything
                        that happens to SMT games and services, which is outside our reasonable control.

                        to reflect changes in CD PROJEKT RED games and services. If so, we will make the changed
                        Agreement available online and make reasonable efforts to tell you about it (e.g. by sending
                        you a notice in the relevant game).
                    </p>

                        We can change this Agreement but if we do we'll put the changed version online, and normally it
                        will take effect a reasonable time period afterwards.

                        18.2 Binding Date. Once we change the Agreement, it will become legally binding on you 30 days
                        after we post it online. During that period, you're welcome to contact us at cs.ptsmt@gmail.com
                        if you have specific questions about the changes.

                        18.3 Disagreeing with Changes. If you don't agree to those changes (regardless of whether you
                        email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using CD PROJEKT RED games and services.
                        We're sorry we have to say that, but we hope you'll appreciate that for CD PROJEKT RED games and
                        services to work properly we need to have everyone using them under the same rules instead of
                        different people having different rules. That's why we encourage you to get in contact if you
                        have queries or concerns
                    </p>

                        If you don’t agree with the changes, then sadly you will need to stop using the SMT
                        games and services
