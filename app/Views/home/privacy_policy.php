                Hello! This Privacy Policy is where we explain how your personal data is collected, stored or used,
                and what happens to it when you're using PT SMT games and services. Like with our User Agreement,
                we have put together two versions: a full text version, which is legally binding, and also section
                summaries, which will hopefully make the legal language sound a bit more accessible. You will need
                to agree to this Privacy Policy before you use a PT SMT game or service for the first time.
                If you have any questions you can contact us at cs.ptsmt@gmail.com. Here we go!
